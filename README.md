## Description

This is a project that I made as a part of my second job application. The task was to make a calendar with events cards that would be shown in the calendar. I used Recoil for State Management. I also used Date-FNS Library to easily manage dates, and the design was inspired by the MUI calendar design. It is conceived that the data (in the form of commits I pushed that day) are displayed in the calendar for the day. To retrieve data from my Github, I used Github's API-Octokit.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Using a GitHub Personal access token for Octokit

To use this library, you must create a Personal access token on GitHub and replace the placeholder string in Grid.js, line 83.
